## 🔍 Key Takeaways

### 🌐 Why Global Applications?
- Enables **low latency**, **high availability**, and **data sovereignty**.
- Ideal for multinational apps and regional failover systems.

### 📍 Route 53
- AWS’s **DNS web service** for domain registration, routing traffic, and health checking.
- Used **latency-based routing**, **geolocation**, and **failover routing**.

### 🌐 CloudFront (CDN)
- Global content delivery network with edge locations.
- Speeds up access to static and dynamic content.

### 🚀 S3 Transfer Acceleration
- Uses CloudFront’s edge locations to **upload large objects** to S3 quickly from any region.

### ⚡ Global Accelerator
- Provides **static IP addresses** that direct users to optimal AWS endpoints.
- Improves **performance and availability** of global applications.

### 🖥️ AWS Outposts
- Brings AWS services **on-premises** for hybrid cloud needs.
- Ideal for **low-latency** or **local data processing** applications.

### 📡 AWS Wavelength & Local Zones
- **Wavelength** places compute and storage at **telecom networks** to reduce latency for mobile apps.
- **Local Zones** place compute resources closer to large metro areas for ultra-low latency.
