## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🔸 **Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)**
- Fully managed **message queuing** service.
- Used to decouple and scale microservices.
- FIFO and Standard queues support different delivery models.

### 🔸 **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)**
- Pub/Sub messaging service for **fan-out** delivery.
- Supports multiple protocols: Email, SMS, HTTP, Lambda, etc.
- Great for **event-driven architectures** and notifications.

### 🔸 **Amazon Kinesis**
- Real-time data **streaming service**.
- Ideal for analytics, dashboards, and telemetry.
- Supports **Kinesis Data Streams**, **Firehose**, and **Analytics**.

### 🔸 **Amazon MQ**
- Managed **Apache ActiveMQ**/RabbitMQ broker.
- Best when migrating legacy applications needing common messaging protocols like **AMQP**, **STOMP**, etc.
